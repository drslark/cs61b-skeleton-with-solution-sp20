# CS61B

All my code for CS61B, UC Berkeley's Data Structures course, taught in Java.

Notable Projects:
1. Enigma:
   - Developed a representation of the Enigma Machine that Germany used to encrypt messages in World War 2
2. Lines of Action:
   - Developed a representation of the game Lines of Action, and implemented an AI player type based on game tree searching and minimax algorithms.
3. Gitlet:
   - Developed a mini version-control system, implementing many features in Git such as adding,committing, branching, switching between branches, and merging.
